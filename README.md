## Run (extra) Locally 

(Note: These files might be outdated because I'm assuming the link above will always go to the "current" version, but the files here are just the ones I manually downloaded, extracted, and uploaded to the repo.)

1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key
3. Run the app:
